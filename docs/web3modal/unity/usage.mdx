# Usage

:::caution

The **Web3Modal SDK for Unity** is currently in **Alpha**. Breaking changes may occur in future versions.

:::

After you have [installed](/web3modal/unity/about#install) and [configured](/web3modal/unity/about#configure) Web3Modal,
you can start using it to interact with the wallet provider and blockchain.

Web3Modal comes with the [Nethereum](https://nethereum.com/) integration out of the box.
You can use it to interact with the EVM chains, smart contracts, convert between different units, etc.

An instance of Nethereum's `Web3` class is available in the `Web3Modal` at `Web3Modal.Web3`.
It's already preconfigured with RPC URL and interceptor that will route the requests between the wallet provider and RPC node.


:::info Warning

Under some circumstances, Web3Modal may create a new instance of `Web3` class with a different configuration.
Therefore, refrain from caching a reference to the `Web3` instance and always use `Web3Modal.Web3` to access it.

```csharp
// ❌ Don't do this
var web3 = Web3Modal.Web3;
await web3.Eth.Blocks.GetBlockNumber.SendRequestAsync();

// ✅ Instead, always use
await Web3Modal.Web3.Eth.Blocks.GetBlockNumber.SendRequestAsync();
```

## Sending Ether

To send ether, you can use the `SendTransactionAsync` method of the `Web3.Eth` class.

```csharp
const string toAddress = "0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045";
await Web3Modal.Web3.Eth
    .GetEtherTransferService()
    .TransferEtherAndWaitForReceiptAsync(toAddress, 0.00001m); // 0.00001 ETH
```

This type of transaction uses the default amount of Gas 21000. Gas price is determined by the wallet provider.
It's possible to specify the gas price and gas limit manually. Refer to the [Nethereum documentation](https://docs.nethereum.com/en/latest/nethereum-transferring-ether/#sending-a-transaction) for more information.

## Reading Blockchain State

#### Get Ether Balance

```csharp
var account = Web3Modal.GetAccount();
var balance = await Web3Modal.Web3.Eth.GetBalance.SendRequestAsync(account.Address);

Debug.Log($"Balance: {Web3.Convert.FromWei(balance.Value)} ETH");
```

## Smart Contract Interaction

It's possible to interact with smart contracts using `Web3Modal.Web3.Eth`.
It comes with a set of popular contract services like `ERC20`, `ERC721`, etc. You can use them to interact with the smart contracts without any additional setup.

### Get ERC20 Token Balance

To get the balance of an ERC20 token, you need to know the contract address and the owner address.
This operation doesn't involve state change on the blockchain, so it's a read-only action that doesn't require a transaction.

```csharp
const string contractAddress = "0x1f9840a85d5aF5bf1D1762F925BDADdC4201F984";
const string ownerAddress = "0x3D30B1aB88D487B0F3061F40De76845Bec3F1e94";

var contractService = Web3Modal.Web3.Eth.ERC20.GetContractService(contractAddress);

var tokenBalance = await contractService.BalanceOfQueryAsync(ownerAddress);
var tokenDecimal = await contractService.DecimalsQueryAsync();

var finalBalance = tokenBalance / BigInteger.Pow(10, tokenDecimal);
```
###

### Send ERC20 Token

To send an ERC20 token, you need to know the contract address, recipient address, and the amount of tokens to send.
This operation requires a transaction and gas fees because it changes the state of the blockchain. User will need to confirm the transaction in the wallet.

```csharp
const string contractAddress = "0x1f9840a85d5aF5bf1D1762F925BDADdC4201F984";
const string recipientAddress = "0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045";
const BigInteger amount = 1;

var contractService = Web3Modal.Web3.Eth.ERC20.GetContractService(contractAddress);

await contractService.TransferRequestAsync(recipientAddress, amount);
```

### Interact with Custom Smart Contracts

Nethereum allows to deploy and interact with custom smart contracts as well.
Refer to the [Nethereum documentation](https://docs.nethereum.com/en/latest/nethereum-smartcontrats-gettingstarted/) for more information.
