# Email Wallets

Web3Modal SDK enables passwordless Web3 onboarding and authentication, allowing your users interact with your application by creating a non-custodial wallet with just their emails.

:::caution

Email wallets are supported from version 3.2.0 and higher. If you are using an older version, make sure to upgrade.

:::

## Integration

In order to support Email Wallets creation just set `enableEmail` parameter to `true` in `W3MService` initialization.

```dart
final _w3mService = W3MService(
  projectId: '{YOUR_PROJECT_ID}',
  metadata: const PairingMetadata(
    ...
  ),
  enableEmail: true, // OPTIONAL - false by default
);
```

## User Flow

1. Users will be able to connect to you application by simply using an email address. Web3Modal will send to them a One Time Password (OTP) to copy and paste in the modal, which will help to verify the user's authenticity. This will create a non-custodial wallet for your user which will be available in any application that integrates Web3Modal and Email Wallets.

2. Eventually the user can optionally choose to move from a non-custodial wallet to a self-custodial one by pressing "Upgrade Wallet" on Web3Modal. This will open the (WalletConnect secure website) that will walk your user through the upgrading process.

:::info Note

Due to Safariâ€™s strict third-party cookie policies, the SDK is not preserving sessions after the app is terminated (removed from memory). So upon app termination the user will have to re-authenticate themself through a new OTP code if they want to sign. Our team is working to solve this issue soon.
